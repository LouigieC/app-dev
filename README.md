1. AVATAR
: On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. Because the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.
3. MARVEL
: When aliens invade Earth in search for the Tesseract — which is in the hands of the mischievous Loki — Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow and other heroes form a team known as the Avengers, who work together to stop an invading alien army.
5. fast and furious
: Dominic Toretto is forced to come out of hiding when a loved one is brutally murdered. Heading to LA to track down the culprit, he crosses paths with Brian O'Connor, the FBI agent whose undercover infiltration of Toretto's gang led to the motorised miscreant's exile across the border. The two men temporarily put their differences aside as they investigate the killing.
